    "text": "The Indian Human Microbiome Initiative (IHMI) is a pioneering national effort to study the microbial landscape of India’s richly varied communities. By sampling over 4,080 healthy individuals from 17 culturally and ecologically distinct groups, IHMI offers the first large-scale insight into how traditional diets, regional environments, and genetic ancestry influence gut microbial ecosystems.\nIHMI represents a foundational framework for advancing global microbiome science by systematically characterizing population-specific microbial signatures from an underrepresented region. It aims to inform precision nutrition and microbiome-guided healthcare solutions tailored specifically to Indian populations bridging a major representation gap in international microbiome studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n4,080#Samples\n\n\n17#Communities\n\n\n10,125#Amplicon Libraries\n\n\n658#Metagenomes\n\n\n61#Human Genomes\n\n\n4,990#HQ-MAGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIHMI Documentary\n\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.

Additionally, Ayurvedic Prakriti Assessment of Subjects is carried out.\nSample Collection, Barcoding and Transportation\n\nStool/Faecal sample is collected and transported in Norgen Stool Nucleic Acid Collection and Preservation System (Cat.

Open the kit, read the instructions and wear gloves.\nPlace the Fe-col collection paper over the toilet seat and collect the stool sample as shown in the figure.\nUnscrew the Stool Nucleic Acid Collection and Preservation Tube and using the spoon attached to the cap, scoop the sample and add in the tube till the liquid reaches the ‘Fill to this Line (White Line)’. Do not over fill. Tighten the cap and shake it gently till stool is mixed with the preservative. Clean up with the alcohol swab.\nBarcodes are anonymized and labelled on to the attached tube. Samples from the fields are collected and transported to the nearest partner institute (AIIMS, KEM/NCCS, SRM, IBSD). Thereafter, NCCS arranges for sample pick-ups from the partner institute via Blue-Dart Courier. Norgen Kit allows sample to be transported at ambient temperature. Norgen kit also renders samples safe and non-infectious."

If necessary, warm the solutions and mix well until the solutions become clear again.\nAlways vortex the Magnetic Bead Suspension before use.\nPrepare a working concentration of the Solution WN by adding 73 mL of 96 - 100 % ethanol to the supplied bottle containing the concentrated Solution WN.

    "text": "IHMI presents the first large scale effort to generate a reference Indian microbiome dataset.\n\n10,125 amplicon libraries sequenced for three domains with a total of 1619.28 billion base pairs from 4080 individuals.\n6.45 tera base pairs of good quality shotgun metagenomic sequencing data from 658 individuals. A total of 53,496 MAGs were identified including the identification of 92 novel MAGs further enriching the microbiome reference resource.\nThis project also catalogued an extensive collection of more than 350 anaerobically isolated gut bacteria some of which exhibit potentially novel taxonomy and probiotic properties.\nData are securely stored on a dedicated server at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC), located at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology (RCB) in Faridabad, India.\nStool samples have been biobanked at AIIMS and SRMIMS to ensure long term access for future research.\nMetagenomic DNA of all samples have been biobanked at NCCS.\nA total of 61 individuals have been characterized for genomic, dietary and microbiome data representing the overlap between GenomeIndia and IHMI project.\n\n\n\nData Access:\nData Access Please reach out to us through IBDC request/access form."

Has an extraordinary variety of interest areas from Influenza to non-communicable diseases to primary health care. One thread that is common to all of them is the advocacy of a public health approach to diseases. My work has spanned the entire spectrum of public health from evidence generation to developing tools for its deployment and finally policies and program development. Evidence generated by the work includes those on burden assessment (Influenza and NCDs and their risk factors), community-based prevention of NCDs, and addressing NCDs through primary health care. Acknowledged as one of the thought leaders in public health in India.”"
