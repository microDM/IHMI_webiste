# About

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
**Anand Krishnan** is a trained public health professional currently working as a Professor in the Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Has an extraordinary variety of interest areas from Influenza to non-communicable diseases to primary health care. One thread that is common to all of them is the advocacy of a public health approach to diseases. My work has spanned the entire spectrum of public health from evidence generation to developing tools for its deployment and finally policies and program development. Evidence generated by the work includes those on burden assessment (Influenza and NCDs and their risk factors), community-based prevention of NCDs, and addressing NCDs through primary health care. Acknowledged as one of the thought leaders in public health in India.”
