# About

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Subrahmanya is working to establish substitutes for rare & endangered medicinal plants (Abhava-Pratinidhi Dravyas) based on Ayurvedic tatva (philosophy), shastra (science) and vyavahara (practice) and traditional quality standards for Indian medicine. I am also deeply interested to contemporize Ayurvedic concepts of food and nutrition, rejuvenator drugs of Ayurveda (Rasayana). Working to establish Ayurveda based nutraceuticals to prevent and manage nutritional deficiency anemia. I am also actively involved in the research on medicinal plant conservation and their sustainable use. I teach fundamental principles of Ayurveda and the medicinal plants used in traditional Indian medicine.
