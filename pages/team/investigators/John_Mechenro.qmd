# About

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
In the field of medical research, I have primarily been involved in epidemiological studies in which I have visited various communities, held focused group discussions with community leaders and sampled individuals based on the demographic requirements of the study. I have been involved in a large multicentre study on celiac disease in which we recruited 12000 participants in Tamil Nadu for a study on the prevalence and determinants of celiac disease. In another ongoing study I have recruited participants from communities located in South India for a collaborative pan-India fecal microbiome study.
